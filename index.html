					<h2>--Who I am--</h2>
					<p>My name is Link, and I'm around 19. I was raised in the Kokiri Forest by the Great Deku Tree, but knew I wasn't of Kokiri origins when I quickly outgrew everyone around me. I was called upon by the Great Deku Tree to take part in an incredible journey.</p>
					<h2>My experience</h2>
					<p class="col col-60">I've gone on several adventures, it all started when I was around 10, and ended, through the will of the Goddess and the magic of time-travel, only a few days. After that I decided to seek out a friend and ended up in a whole new world and found myself wrapped up in another adventure. In my time I've cleared approx. 20 dungeons and are proficient in swordsmanship, swimming, multiple disguises, perception, and with a bow, bombs, boomerangs, slingshots, hookshots, crystal magic, and puzzle solving on a large scale.</p>
